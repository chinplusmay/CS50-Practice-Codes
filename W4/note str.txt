// note for strings
suppose a string 
string s = "HI!"   
->here is the string of 3 character + \0 at end
the address of s is same as of 'H'(the very first letter of string)
becoz we can go byte after byte after H until we see null char(\0) 
->THERE IS NO STRING FN IN C U CAN IT USING CS50 LIB
basically its a pointer to a character--> char *s = "HI!"//
